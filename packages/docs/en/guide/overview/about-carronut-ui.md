## Author's Note

> I'm not a designer, nor do I claim to be an expert in design. This UI library targets developers rather than designers, and while it can be used for commercial projects, its primary purpose isn't commercialization. One of my main motivations for creating this UI library was to build something fun and whimsical rather than overly commercial. It's also meant to provide a reliable UI solution for small toy projects without having to sift through countless options.

> Regarding user-friendliness, I can only draw insights from my own UI experiences and developer feedback. Some might argue that UI doesn't need excessive animations - simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. Others may question why reinvent the wheel when there are already so many polished, well-supported UI libraries available. While I acknowledge these valid concerns, this UI library itself might be my personal answer to those questions.
